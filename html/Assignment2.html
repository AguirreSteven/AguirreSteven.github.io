          The Strokes
      </h1>
    <p>I recently started listening to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0epOFNiUfyON9EYx7Tpr6V" title="The Strokes spotify">The Strokes</a> discography these last couple of weeks. I always knew they existed, but I never gave all of their albums a chance. I made a <i>little</i> list of some of my favorites songs across each album
        but overall they are a great band. The lead singer, <strong>Julian Casablancas</strong> has a sort of tone in his music that is reminicent of mid 90s rock and it is <strong>exceptional.</strong> Some of my favorite songs so far are 
        <strong>Ize of the World</strong> and <strong>The Adults Are Talking.</strong><a href = "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81xesqe7UML._SL1500_.jpg" title="This Is It"> <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.thecrimson.com/photos/2020/05/16/172036_1344567.jpg"></p>
